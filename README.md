## Communication (how to + my personal style)

### Philosophy

- I am a strong believer in the power of [async communication](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) in a distributed team.
- As many (esp those of us with ADHD) know, the negative cognitive impact of context switching / interruptions is _high_.
- To be [effective](https://nesslabs.com/efficacy-effectiveness-efficiency) at work, I attempt to batch all my notifications / create protected space for focused work without distraction

### How to talk to me

- **Do not worry about interrupting / disturbing me** Have something to say? Ping me / @mention me in slack / confluence / github / send me an email whenever you like day or night - my lobby is always open :)
- **I don't typically reply immediately** I generally reply promptly, but prioritize intentional time blocking over time to first response. I won't reply when I am not at work.
- **I believe strongly in the power of written communication and generally prefer this mode of interaction** Written communication requires intentionality and thought, and concise and direct writing indicates a respect for the intended recipient(s) time. When shared in a public forum, it promotes transparency and open dialog, and enables truly async collaboration.
  - **Putting this into practice**
    - Have a question? Ask in a public slack channel (eg - `#help-graphql`) and @mention me if you believe I might have the answer
    - Too much to write down? Consider sharing a screen recording & transcript with a tool such as loom.
- **Timing**
  - My slack "active" indicator is deeply misleading.
  - Wanna know if I'm around? Check my calendar :)

### Why this matters

**Synchronous conversations are extremely valuable.** We are all humans, and social beings. Synchronous mediums (video/voice chats/real-time slack conversations) are incredibly valuable as means for us to connect socially, while working remotely. And this is a hugely important aspect of work IMO - building a healthy & thriving workplace where everyone is able to contribute their best work only happens when we acknowledge and celebrate each other as full human beings with thoughts, feelings, interests, aspirations, struggles, wins etc.

Does this happen automatically to some extent? Yes. Can we benefit further from cultivating it intentionally? Hell yeah. Does it look the same at every scale (team / dept / org)? Of course not.

We are not cogs in a machine or bricks in a wall. But we also co-create the environment which we inhabit :)

#### Putting this into practice

- **Make space in the workday for social connection**
  - Ruthlessly optimize all other functions of meetings:
    - Have as few as possible
    - Have a designated owner / facilitator for every meeting
    - Distribute an agenda at least 24hrs before the meeting, in a form where folks can add comments / questions ahead of time
    - Respect participant's time by sticking to the agenda and ending the meeting at it's scheduled time
    - Capture outcomes & share publicly with 24h after the meeting has ended
    - Don't waste any individual's time / compromise their ability to contribute by doing this manually ^ (having someone take notes). It's 2025 - let the computers do this for us (fathom.video, otter.ai, etc) ü§ñ
  - Build in time for general chatter & social connection - have informal 1 on 1 chats
  - engage in interest-based slack channels - work on discovery time projects with people from other teams
  - protect time at the team level by building it into the regularly occurring rituals. Examples:
    - implement a meeting-free day of the week
    - create a gap between the end of a sprint / start of the next for discovery projects etc
- Leverage work calendars effectively
  - Keep availability on work calendars up to date
  - Make availability clear by setting working hours & blocking unavailable time (I use [cron](https://cron.com/) to automatically block events from my personal calendar on my work calendar)
  - Use the calendar as a tool to communicate intention by blocking out focus time
